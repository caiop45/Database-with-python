This Python code creates a PostgreSQL database, creates a table named "students" with columns for student information, inserts two rows of data into the table, and then retrieves the data from the table to validate that it was successfully inserted. The code also includes error handling to catch any issues that may arise during the process.
The present code has been developed based on a didactic and comprehensive online video tutorial, which was available on the internet and provided step-by-step instructions for the creation and manipulation of a PostgreSQL database using Python and the psycopg2 library.
